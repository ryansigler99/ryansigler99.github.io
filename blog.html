    <h3>9/28/06: John Fortnite's Nail Saloon</h3>
    
    <h5>Hey kids what time is it? Howdy Doody time! (Doc wakes up and grabs his head, as though it hurts.) Great Scott! Ooh...Howdy Doody time! (Doc goes over and picks up his recorder. He begins to record his daily journal.) Date, Sunday, November 13th, 1955 7:01 AM. Last night's time travel experiment was apparently a complete success. Lightning struck the clock tower at precisely 10:04 pm sending the necessary 1.21 giggowatts into the time vehicle, which vanished in a brilliant flash of light leaving a pair of fire trails behind. I therefore assumed that Marty and the time vehicle were transported forward through time into the year 1985. After that...after that...I can't recall what happened. I don't even remember how I got home! Perhaps the giggowatt discharge coupled with the temporal displacement field generated by the time vehicle caused a disruption of my own brain waves resulting in a condition of temporary amnesia. Indeed I now recall the moments after the time vehicle disappeared ... into the future ... I saw a vision of Marty saying, "I've come back from the future." (Marty gets up behind him, and because Doc's back is to him, Doc doesn't see him.) Undoubtedly this was some sort ofâ€¦</h5>

    <h5>You know him! (turns back around) Emmett! (She gets up and pulls on a cable that causes the train to stop. Everyone jerks as the train comes to a quick stop. Clara jumps off the train and starts running back towards Hill Valley.) (Hill Valley - Main Street) (Tannen and his gang, along with Doc, are waiting for Marty.)What, are you deaf old man? He just said it was over! You lost! Oh yeah? (He turns the volume up.) (v.o) Here comes Decker with the kick, it's up, it looks good folks, it looks very good, field goal! UCLA wins 19 to 17! (As the announcer keeps talking, 1955 Biff looks at his future self in amazement.) Alright pops, what's the gag? How did you know what the score was gonna be?Yeah, where does he live? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. (Doc's Workshop) (Doc is watching the video of 1985 Doc. Marty walks in and sees him.) My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.</h5>

            <h3>5/23/89: Aidan Fitzwater's Batcave</h3>
    
    <h5>Before he died. Yeah right. So there I was, minding my own business, (he opens the safe) when this crazy old codger with a cane shows up. (He takes a box out of the safe.) He says he's my distant relative. I didn't see any resemblance. (He puts the box on the table.) So he says "How would you like to be rich?" So I say "Sure." (He opens the box and takes the sports almanac from it.) So he lays this book on me. He says this book'll tell me the outcome of every sporting event 'til the end of the century. All I have to do is bet on the winner, and I'll never lose. So I say "What's the catch?" He says, "No catch, just keep it a secret." (Biff puts the book back in the box and closes it.) After that he disappeared. I never saw him again. (Marty takes a "Biff's Pleasure Paradise" matchbox and puts it in his pocket.) Oh, and he told me one other thing. He said some day, a crazy wild eyed scientist or a kid may show up asking about that book. And if that ever happened... (Biff laughs as he pulls out a gun.) Funny, I never thought it would be you. Yeah well Biff, you're forgetting one thing. What the hell is that? (He points behind Biff. Biff looks, and Marty throws the matchbox tray at him. It hits the chair just about Biff's head. Marty runs off. Biff turns back and sees him go. He fires at Marty and misses.) You're dead, you little son of a bitch!</h5>
