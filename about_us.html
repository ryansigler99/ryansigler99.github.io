<h3>Two of them? (DeLorean) (Marty says hello to Einstein.) I left him in a suspended animation kennel. Einstein never knew I was gone! (gets out of the car) Marty! What in the name of Sir Isaac H Newton happened here? Oh yeah, Doc, listen, my kid showed up, all hell broke loose.Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. (Doc pulls his sunglasses down and hits a button. Suddenly the car is airborne. They take off into the future.) (Hill Valley â€“ 1985) (We pick up where Part 1, left off. Marty opens the garage and inside is the Toyota truck he admired earlier. Marty walks up to it and looks inside. He slaps the door of the truck. Jennifer walks up behind him.) How about a ride, Mister?</h3>

<h3>Ohh, no. No, Doc. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Yeah. (Down the Street)Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your Pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Uh, I think so. What did she say? (There's a knock at the door before Marty can answer. Doc goes to see who it is.) It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.</h3>

<h3>You do? You know what I do in those situations? What? I don't worry. (she leans over and kisses him, then leans back with a weird look on her face.) This is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.(o.s) Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother! (1985 Marty creeps past the car unseen as we hear Lorraine and 1955 Marty speaking.) When I have kids, I'm going to let them do anything they want. Anything at all. (in the car) I'd like to have that in writing. (outside the car) Yeah, me too.</h3>

<h3>(Marty is writing Doc a letter.) Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. (Main Street) Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Oh, just a little weather experiment.He's an absolute dream. (Biff and his friends hop into Biff's car and take off after Marty. They manage to catch up to him. He's on his board right in front of their car. He holds on to the hood since he can't get away.) Ah. Whoa. (Biff spots a manure truck and heads straight for it.) I'm gonna ram him.</h3>
